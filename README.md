## 📚 Overview

This project contains practice HTML code as I learn and explore the basics of front-end web development.  
It uses only **HTML5** and **inline CSS** — no JavaScript, no forms with actual functionality, and no third-party dependencies.

- Basic structure (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`)
- Headings, paragraphs, and text formatting
- Links and internal navigation (`<a href="#id">`)
- Images and multimedia embedding
- Semantic HTML: `<header>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, etc.
- Forms (non-functional) for layout practice only
- Tables with `thead`, `tbody`, `caption`, `colspan`, and `rowspan`
- Expandable content with `<details>` and `<summary>`
