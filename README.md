# HTML Practice by Siam Mehraf

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This repository contains my HTML practice work as I learn and master the basics of web development.  
It includes examples of:

- Basic structure (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`)
- Text formatting (`<p>`, `<h1>`, `<b>`, `<i>`, `<u>`, etc.)
- Links and navigation
- Images and videos
- Lists (ordered and unordered)
- Tables with `thead`, `tbody`, `caption`, `colspan`, and `rowspan`
- Forms with inputs, labels, textareas, checkboxes, radio buttons
- Semantic tags (`<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, etc.)
- Interactive elements (`<details>`, `<summary>`)
- Internal linking using `id` attributes
- Multimedia embedding with `<iframe>`, `<video>`

## ðŸ”¥ Goals:
- Build strong HTML fundamentals
- Practice clean, structured, and valid HTML
- Prepare for learning CSS, JavaScript, and full-stack development

## ðŸ“… Progress:
I will keep updating this repository as I continue learning and building more projects!
